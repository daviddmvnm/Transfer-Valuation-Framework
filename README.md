# FIFA Player Valuation & Development Framework ⚽

A data-driven framework for identifying undervalued football players and quantifying the financial returns of targeted skill development. Originally developed as a technical case study presented to senior data scientists and data science managers in a stakeholder simulation exercise for a major payments company. ( I did pass the technical but sold the bag on the final round 💔 )

## Key Findings

- **The Offensive Premium**: Elite offensive players are valued at 2.6× their defensive counterparts. The market systematically rewards dribbling, passing, and shooting over defensive ability — even within the same leagues, clubs, and positions.
- **Development ROI**: Offensive skill development adds €550K–€880K in value across all positions. Even defenders gain ~1.9× more from offensive development than defensive improvement.
- **Position-Specific Pathways**: Each position has a unique combination of skills that unlocks the offensive premium — there is no one-size-fits-all development strategy.

## Scouting Model

The framework includes a player identification model that:

1. Finds players closest to the next elite skill tier, targeting those needing the smallest improvements to progress
2. Applies position-specific skill weightings for defenders, midfielders, and attackers
3. Ranks candidates by development feasibility, combining age and effort required

**Validation**: Case studies using 2021–2022 data identified players (e.g. Mitchell, Livramento, Guehi) who subsequently achieved 2–2.5× value appreciation on the transfer market.

## Methods

- **Clustering** (K-Means) to identify distinct elite player archetypes
- **Regression analysis** to quantify marginal returns of skill development by position
- **Threshold-based scouting** to identify players near valuation breakpoints

## Setup
